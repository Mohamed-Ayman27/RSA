## RSA Implementation using BRAM on Xilinx ISE and Spartan-6 FPGA
This project is an implementation of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption algorithm using Block RAM (BRAM) on the Xilinx ISE design suite and targeting the Spartan-6 FPGA. The primary objective of this implementation is to reduce the hardware resource utilization by utilizing BRAM for storing the values of the modulus operation.
